## Gameplay

The main objective of the game is to **prepare sandwiches according to customer orders**.  
Players follow a series of steps representing the restaurant workflow:

1. **Shopping Phase** – The player begins by purchasing ingredients needed for sandwich preparation.  
2. **Restaurant Phase** – After completing the shopping, the player enters the restaurant to fulfill customer orders.  
3. **Order Management** – Orders are displayed by a **robot assistant**, which guides the player through each requested sandwich.  
4. **Sandwich Assembly** – The player selects and places ingredients to create sandwiches according to the robot’s instructions.  
5. **Error Handling & Recycling** – In case of mistakes, misplaced or incorrect ingredients can be placed in a **recycling bag**. These items can later be **resold** to recover a percentage of their original value.
